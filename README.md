#  Sales Analysis Project

This project helps us understand how well a shop is doing by looking at data from orders and products.

We use  **SQL queries** to answer questions like:

- How much money do we make each month?
- Which product types bring in the most money?
- Who are our best customers?
- How many people buy more than once?
- What are the most popular products?
- Which products don’t sell well but we still have a lot in stock?
- Are there any mistakes in the order prices?
- Are there customers with the same email by mistake?

##  What’s inside this project?

- `sales_analysis_report.md` – A report with all the questions and SQL code we used.
- SQL code blocks – These are like mini-programs that ask the database for answers.

##  What do you need?

You need a database that has these tables:
- `ORDERS`
- `ORDER_ITEMS`
- `PRODUCTS`
- `CUSTOMERS`

And you need a tool like:
- microsoft SQL Server 


##  Why is this useful?

This project helps you:
- Learn how to use SQL
- Practice thinking with data
- Understand how shops track sales and stock

##  Output of the queries are found on the outputs folder pictures?
