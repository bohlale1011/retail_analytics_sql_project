Sales Analysis Report Summary

Monthly Revenue Trend:
We check how much money we made each month in the past year. We do this by adding
up the total order money for each month.

SELECT FORMAT(order_date, 'yyyy-MM') AS [Month], 

SUM(total_amount) AS Monthly_Revenue

FROM ORDERS

WHERE order_date >= DATEADD(YEAR, -1, GETDATE())

GROUP BY FORMAT(order_date, 'yyyy-MM')

ORDER BY [Month];

2024 - 09 1325.

2024 - 10 2174.

2024 - 11 1981.

2024 - 12 2393.

2025 - 05 1882.

2025 - 06 1742.

2025 - 07 1551.

We use the FORMAT function to group orders by month over the last year, then sum the
total revenue per month.

Product Categories Revenue:
We find out which types of products made the most money by multiplying how many were
sold by their prices.

SELECT P.category, SUM(OI.quantity * OI.price) AS Total_Revenue

FROM ORDER_ITEMS OI

JOIN PRODUCTS P ON OI.product_id = P.product_id

GROUP BY P.category

ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;

Lifetime Value (CLV) is calculated by summing all orders per customer. We sort and take
the top 10.

Percentage of Repeat Customers:
We find how many customers ordered more than once, and show this as a percentage of
all customers.

SELECT CAST(100.0 * COUNT() / (SELECT COUNT() FROM CUSTOMERS) AS
DECIMAL(5,2)) AS Percentage_Multiple_Orders

FROM ( SELECT customer_id FROM ORDERS GROUP BY customer_id HAVING
COUNT(*) > 1 ) AS MultiOrderCustomers;

Percentage_Multiple_Orders 83.

We calculate the percentage of customers who made more than one order by comparing
grouped orders with total customers. Product Performance

Operational & Data Quality

Orders with Incorrect Totals:
We check if the total cost in the order is different from the sum of the prices of items
bought. This could mean thereâ€™s a mistake.

SELECT O.order_id, O.total_amount, SUM(OI.quantity * OI.price) AS
calculated_total FROM ORDERS O

JOIN ORDER_ITEMS OI ON O.order_id = OI.order_id GROUP BY O.order_id,
O.total_amount HAVING ROUND(SUM(OI.quantity * OI.price), 2) !=
ROUND(O.total_amount, 2);

Check if the order's total_amount matches the calculated sum from order_items.

Duplicate Emails:
We see if any customers are using the same email more than once. That might be an error.

SELECT
email,

COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count

FROM

CUSTOMERS

GROUP BY

email

HAVING

COUNT(*) > 1;

Detect repeated email addresses in the customers table.

Bonus View Customer_Lifetime_Value View:

We created a program (called a stored procedure) that shows how much money each
customer has spent. We can use this program anytime without writing the full query again.

CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomerLifetimeValue AS

BEGIN

SELECT C.customer_id, C.name, C.email, SUM(O.total_amount) AS
Lifetime_Value

FROM CUSTOMERS C

JOIN ORDERS O ON C.customer_id = O.customer_id GROUP BY C.customer_id,
C.name, C.email;

END;

A view that calculates total value each customer has spent. Can be queried repeatedly for
reporting CLV.
